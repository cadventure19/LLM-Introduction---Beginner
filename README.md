# LLM-Introduction-Beginner
Any beginner who wants to starts its journey in LLM, should know these fundamental question before diving deep into the mathmatics of it.




1. What is exactly LLM? 
- > It stands for Large Language Model. Models are trained on large amount of data( web data, book, code) e.g. Chatpgt. 

2. What is chatgpt? (gpt stands for generative pre-trained transformer) 
-> It is model that generate human like response. Its like a chat-bot that can engages in conversation. 

3. How it works? 
-> chatgpt - It predicts the next word based on the sentence so far. It uses transformer ( a network structure) which uses self attention mechanism( which stores the importance of words w.r.t to each other) to predict the next word. 

4. Where it can be used to solve the business problem?
   
-> i) Eg. At fintech- a lot of time/bandwidth is used to resolve a ticket. So whenever an escalation come, it can be related to blocked/ blacklisted. We can build a mechanism to automatically answer these.

-> ii) To perform investigation - An investigation is done based on number of parameters. We can give these parameters to the LLM and fine-tune the model based on past investigation.
